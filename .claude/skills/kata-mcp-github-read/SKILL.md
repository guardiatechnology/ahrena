# Kata: Query projects and code on GitHub via MCP

> **Prefix:** `kata-` | **Type:** Repeatable Skill | **Scope:** Reading repositories, issues, pull requests, commits, and code on GitHub via MCP server

## Workflow

```
Progress:
- [ ] 1. Verify MCP preconditions and directives
- [ ] 2. Identify repository and query object
- [ ] 3. Fetch and read the content
- [ ] 4. Present result to user
```

### Step 1: Verify MCP preconditions and directives

1. Consult `.ahrena/.directives` per `lex-directives`.
2. Verify that `github` is listed in `mcp.servers` (per `lex-mcp`). If not, inform the user and stop.
3. Confirm that the `GITHUB_PAT` environment variable is defined. If not, inform the user which variable to configure and stop.
4. Consult `codex-mcp-github` to identify the correct tools and parameters.

### Step 2: Identify repository and query object

1. Confirm the repository (`owner/repo`) with the user — ask if not provided.
2. Identify the query object:
   - **`file`** — content of a file or directory listing
   - **`code`** — code search by term or pattern
   - **`issues`** — list or details of issues
   - **`prs`** — list or details of pull requests
   - **`commits`** — commit history for a branch
   - **`branches`** — available branches in the repository
3. If the object was not specified, ask the user which aspect of the repository they want to query.

### Step 3: Fetch and read the content

**Object `file`:**
1. Call `get_file_contents(owner, repo, path, branch)`.
2. If `path` is a directory, list the returned items and ask the user which file to expand.
3. If `path` is a file, present the full content with language highlighting.

**Object `code`:**
1. Call `search_code(query="{term} repo:{owner}/{repo}")`.
2. Present the matching files with relevant snippets.
3. For files of interest, call `get_file_contents` to retrieve the full content if the user requests it.

**Object `issues`:**
1. Call `list_issues(owner, repo, state, labels, assignee)` with filters provided by the user.
2. Present the list (number, title, state, labels, assignee, opened date).
3. If the user wants details on a specific issue, call `get_issue(owner, repo, issue_number)`.

**Object `prs`:**
1. Call `list_pull_requests(owner, repo, state, head, base)` with provided filters.
2. Present the list (number, title, state, head/base branch, author, date).
3. If the user wants details on a specific PR, call `get_pull_request(owner, repo, pull_number)`.

**Object `commits`:**
1. Call `list_commits(owner, repo, branch)`.
2. Present the history (abbreviated hash, message, author, date).
3. Default to the 20 most recent commits; ask the user if they want more.

### Step 4: Present result to user

1. Present the retrieved content in a structured, readable format.
2. For lists (issues, PRs, commits): use a table with the most relevant fields.
3. For files and code: preserve the original formatting with a code block and identified language.
4. Include the direct GitHub URL for each item when available in the tool response.

## Outputs

| Output | Format | Destination |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| File content | Code block with identified language | Response to user |
| Code search results | List of files with relevant snippets | Response to user |
| Issues / PRs list | Table with relevant fields | Response to user |
| Commit history | Table (hash, message, author, date) | Response to user |

## Restrictions

- **Read-only:** this kata never creates branches, issues, PRs, comments, or pushes files.
- **Use MCP only:** never use the `gh` CLI or the GitHub REST API directly when the MCP server is active (per `lex-mcp`).
- **No hardcoded credentials:** authentication exclusively via `GITHUB_PAT` environment variable.
- **Confirm repository:** always confirm `owner/repo` with the user before starting the query.
