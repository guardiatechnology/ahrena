# Codex: .directives File Manual

> **Prefix:** `codex-` | **Type:** Reference Manual | **Scope:** Canonical configuration of the Ahrena framework

## Overview

This Codex documents the `.ahrena/.directives` file, which centralizes the framework's canonical configuration. It describes the purpose of each section, the meaning of each key, and when to use each path or option. It is the reference manual that complements `lex-directives` (which establishes the obligation to read and apply the file). Consult the Lex for the law; consult this Codex to interpret and extend `.directives`.

## Context

- **Domain:** Cross-cutting Ahrena configuration (paths, languages, terminal, naming, tone)
- **Audience:** AI agents, framework maintainers, and integrators who install or customize Ahrena
- **Update:** Whenever a new section is added to `.directives` or the meaning of a key changes

## Content

### Purpose of the file

The `.directives` file is the single source of truth for:

- Canonical framework paths (where templates, artifacts, specs live)
- Default language and mandatory languages for artifacts
- Terminal type for commands (bash or PowerShell)
- Naming conventions (prefixes, extensions, casing, addressing, reserved clades)
- Tone and writing style for artifacts and communication

No agent must infer these values without consulting the file (per `lex-directives`).

### Section `paths`

| Key | Meaning | Use |
|-----|---------|-----|
| `paths.root` | Framework root directory in the project | `.ahrena/` — entry point in any project that adopts Ahrena |
| `paths.directives` | Path to the directives file | `.ahrena/.directives` — always relative to repository root |
| `paths.templates` | Templates directory in the framework repo | `templates/` — contains samples (lex, codex, kata, warrior, cry) |
| `paths.framework` | Framework directory in the Ahrena repo | `framework/` — tree by language and clade |
| `paths.project_artifacts` | Where to create project-specific artifacts before pushing to framework | `.ahrena/artifacts/` — same structure as framework |
| `paths.oas` | Destination for OpenAPI specifications | E.g. `docs/oas` |
| `paths.events` | Destination for CloudEvents documentation | E.g. `docs/events` |
| `paths.samples.lexis` | Lexis template path | E.g. `templates/lex-sample.md` |
| `paths.samples.codex` | Codex template path | E.g. `templates/codex-sample.md` |
| `paths.samples.katas` | Katas template path | E.g. `templates/kata-sample.md` |
| `paths.samples.warriors` | Warriors template path | E.g. `templates/warrior-sample.md` |
| `paths.samples.cries` | Cries template path | E.g. `templates/cry-sample.md` |

When creating artifacts, always use the paths from `paths.samples` (or the equivalent in `.directives`) to locate the template. For when to use `project_artifacts` vs `framework`, see `codex-paths`.

### Section `language`

| Key | Meaning | Use |
|-----|---------|-----|
| `language.default` | Default framework language | E.g. `pt-BR` — artifacts are created in this language first; source of truth |
| `language.i18n` | List of mandatory languages | E.g. `pt-BR`, `es`, `en` — every framework artifact must exist in all |
| `language.cursor` | Language used in generated Cursor artifacts (`.mdc`) | E.g. `en` — single language in `.cursor/`; no language folders |

See `lex-framework-language` and `codex-framework-language` for the folder structure by language.

### Section `terminal`

| Key | Meaning | Use |
|-----|---------|-----|
| `terminal` | Shell type for commands | Values: `bash` or `powershell` — agents must use this type when proposing or executing commands (see `lex-terminal-type` and `codex-terminal-type`) |

If absent, the agent infers from the operating system or asks the user.

### Section `naming`

| Key | Meaning | Use |
|-----|---------|-----|
| `naming.prefixes.lexis` | Lexis file prefix | `lex-` |
| `naming.prefixes.codex` | Codex file prefix | `codex-` |
| `naming.prefixes.katas` | Katas file prefix | `kata-` |
| `naming.prefixes.warriors` | Warriors file prefix | `warrior-` |
| `naming.prefixes.cries` | Cries file prefix | `cry-` |
| `naming.extensions.framework` | Extension in framework | `.md` |
| `naming.extensions.cursor` | Extension in Cursor (rules) | `.mdc` |
| `naming.casing.files` | File naming convention | E.g. `kebab-case` |
| `naming.casing.directories` | Directory naming convention | E.g. `kebab-case` |
| `naming.addressing` | Artifact addressing pattern | `{lang}/{clade}/{subclade}/{pilar}/{prefix}-{name}.{ext}` |
| `naming.reserved_clades` | Clades with special rules (prefix `_`) | E.g. `_foundation` |
| `naming.tone_and_writing_style` | List of tone and style guidelines | Applied when producing artifacts and communication (see `lex-tone` and `codex-tone`) |

See `codex-naming` for details and examples; see `lex-naming` for the law that mandates these conventions.

### Artifact header (block quote)

In the first line of every framework artifact (Lexis, Codex, Katas, Warriors, Cries), the block quote contains **Prefix**, **Type**, and **Scope**. The **Prefix** field **MUST** state the **actual prefix value** (e.g. `lex-`, `codex-`, `kata-`, `warrior-`, `cry-`), and **NOT** only a reference to the directive.

| Form | Correct | Incorrect |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Prefix** | `**Prefix:** \`lex-\` \| **Type:** ...` | `**Prefix:** per naming.prefixes.lexis in .directives \| ...` |
| Reason | The artifact is self-describing; the reader sees the Pilar prefix immediately | The directive reference requires consulting `.directives` to know the value; in printed docs or outside the repo context, the prefix is ambiguous |

The prefix value MUST match the one defined in `naming.prefixes.{pilar}` in `.directives` (in the Ahrena repo, typically `lex-`, `codex-`, `kata-`, `warrior-`, `cry-`). When creating or reviewing artifacts, use the actual prefix value in the header.

### Extensibility

New sections may be added to `.directives` (e.g. `security`, `notifications`). The agent must interpret unknown sections reasonably. The file **MUST NOT** be modified by the agent without explicit user request (`lex-directives`).

### Relationship with lex-directives

- **lex-directives:** Establishes that every agent MUST read and apply `.directives` before producing artifacts or communication. Defines application per section (paths, language, naming.*).
- **codex-directives:** Explains what each section and key mean and when to use them. Use the Lex for the obligation; use this Codex for interpretation and quick reference.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Directive | Key-value pair (or nested structure) in the `.directives` file that governs an aspect of framework behavior |
| Canonical path | Path defined in `paths` that all agents must use when referencing or creating artifacts |
| Source of truth | The language defined in `language.default`; versions in other languages must be equivalent to it |
